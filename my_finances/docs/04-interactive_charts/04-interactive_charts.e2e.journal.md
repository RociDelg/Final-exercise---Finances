# E2E Test Journal for Interactive Charts

## Implementation Summary

This journal documents the implementation of end-to-end tests for the interactive charts feature. The tests cover all the core functionality described in the feature blueprint, including chart type switching, customization, configuration persistence, period comparison, and interactive tooltips.

The tests follow the project's e2e testing standards and are implemented using Playwright.

## Test Scenarios

The following test scenarios have been implemented:

1. **Chart Type Switching**
   - Verifies that users can switch between bar, line, and pie charts
   - Confirms that the chart updates appropriately for each type
   - Validates that data is correctly formatted for each chart type

2. **Chart Customization**
   - Tests the customization panel functionality
   - Verifies color changes are applied
   - Confirms label modifications are reflected
   - Validates that changes are immediately visible

3. **Configuration Persistence**
   - Tests saving chart configurations
   - Verifies that configurations persist after page refresh
   - Confirms that saved settings are correctly applied
   - Validates success message display

4. **Period Comparison**
   - Tests switching between monthly and yearly views
   - Verifies that both periods are displayed correctly
   - Confirms proper data aggregation for each period
   - Validates that data points are visible for both periods

5. **Interactive Tooltips**
   - Tests tooltip display on hover
   - Verifies tooltip content (value, date, category)
   - Confirms tooltip disappearance on mouse out
   - Validates tooltip positioning and styling

## Implementation Details

The tests are implemented in `tests/e2e/04-interactive_charts.spec.ts` and follow these patterns:

- Each test is independent and isolated
- Common setup is handled in the `beforeEach` hook, including login
- Tests use descriptive names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- Assertions verify both UI elements and functionality
- Error scenarios are tested to ensure proper validation

## Running the Tests

To run the interactive charts e2e tests:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only the interactive charts tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/04-interactive_charts.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Commit Prompt

```
feat(e2e): implement interactive charts e2e tests

- Add comprehensive e2e tests for interactive charts feature
- Cover chart type switching, customization, and persistence
- Implement period comparison and tooltip testing
- Follow project e2e testing standards
```

## Next Steps

1. Add tests for chart data export functionality
2. Implement tests for chart sharing features
3. Add tests for chart annotation capabilities
4. Implement visual regression tests for different chart types
