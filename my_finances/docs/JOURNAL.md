## Development Decisions

### 2024-03-19
1. **Project Structure**
   - Decided to use a feature-based architecture
   - Implemented layered architecture for better separation of concerns
   - Chose Angular Material for UI components

2. **Authentication**
   - Selected LocalStorage Authentication for user management
   - Decided to use JWT tokens for session management

3. **Data Storage**
   - Chose LocalStorage for data persistence
   - Implemented data models for User, Transaction, and Chart entities
   - Designed data flow architecture

4. **UI/UX**
   - Selected Chart.js for data visualization
   - Implemented responsive design
   - Added dark mode support with system preference detection

## Technical Debt

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Set up proper testing environment

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Optimize chart rendering
- [ ] Improve data export performance
- [ ] Add loading states

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add animations
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add tooltips

## Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Angular for better performance and features
- Implementing functional programming paradigm
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Following Angular best practices and style guide

### Security Considerations
- Implementing proper authentication flow
- Using secure token storage
- Following OWASP security guidelines
- Implementing proper input validation

### Performance Considerations
- Using lazy loading for modules
- Implementing proper caching strategies
- Optimizing chart rendering
- Using proper data structures

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Tasks**
