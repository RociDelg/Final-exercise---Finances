# E2E Test Journal for Filters and Search

## Implementation Summary

This journal documents the implementation of end-to-end tests for the filters and search feature. The tests cover all the core functionality described in the feature blueprint, including real-time search across all fields, multiple filter application, filter clearing, result count display, and special character handling.

The tests follow the project's e2e testing standards and are implemented using Playwright.

## Test Scenarios

The following test scenarios have been implemented:

1. **Real-time Search**
   - Verifies that search results update in real-time
   - Confirms that search works across all transaction fields
   - Validates that matching text is highlighted in results
   - Tests search with different types of content (text, numbers, dates)

2. **Multiple Filter Application**
   - Tests applying date range filters
   - Verifies category selection
   - Confirms transaction type filtering
   - Validates that all filters work simultaneously
   - Checks that results show only matching transactions
   - Verifies result count display

3. **Filter Clearing**
   - Tests the "Clear All Filters" functionality
   - Verifies that all filters are reset to default state
   - Confirms that the full transaction list is displayed
   - Validates that filter count is reset

4. **Filter Result Counts**
   - Tests display of result counts in filter dropdowns
   - Verifies that counts update when other filters are applied
   - Confirms that zero results are clearly indicated
   - Validates count display format

5. **Special Character Handling**
   - Tests search with various special characters
   - Verifies that search works without errors
   - Confirms that results update appropriately
   - Validates handling of all special characters

## Implementation Details

The tests are implemented in `tests/e2e/05-filters_and_search.spec.ts` and follow these patterns:

- Each test is independent and isolated
- Common setup is handled in the `beforeEach` hook, including login
- Tests use descriptive names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- Assertions verify both UI elements and functionality
- Error scenarios are tested to ensure proper validation

## Running the Tests

To run the filters and search e2e tests:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only the filters and search tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/05-filters_and_search.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Commit Prompt

```
feat(e2e): implement filters and search e2e tests

- Add comprehensive e2e tests for filters and search feature
- Cover real-time search, multiple filters, and filter clearing
- Implement result count and special character testing
- Follow project e2e testing standards
```

## Next Steps

1. Add tests for filter persistence between sessions
2. Implement tests for filter preset functionality
3. Add tests for search history and suggestions
4. Implement tests for filter tag display and removal
