# Feature: **05 - Filters and Search**

## Description

This feature enables users to efficiently find and filter their financial transactions through real-time search and advanced filtering capabilities. Users can search across all transaction fields and combine multiple filters to narrow down their results. The system provides immediate feedback on the number of results for each filter option.

## Involved Data Models

- **Transaction**: The primary data model being searched and filtered.
- **User**: Associated with transactions for data ownership and filtering.

## Acceptance Criteria (in Gherkin Syntax)

```gherkin
Feature: Filters and Search
  As a user
  I want to search and filter my transactions
  So that I can quickly find specific financial records

  Scenario: Real-time search across all fields
    Given I am on the transactions page
    When I type in the search box
    Then the results should update in real-time
    And the search should look through all transaction fields
    And the matching text should be highlighted in results

  Scenario: Apply multiple filters
    Given I am on the transactions page
    When I select a date range
    And I select a category
    And I select a transaction type
    Then all filters should be applied simultaneously
    And the results should show only matching transactions
    And the number of results should be displayed

  Scenario: Clear all filters
    Given I have multiple active filters
    When I click the "Clear All Filters" button
    Then all filters should be reset to their default state
    And the full list of transactions should be displayed
    And the filter count should be reset

  Scenario: View filter result counts
    Given I am on the transactions page
    When I open a filter dropdown
    Then each filter option should show the number of matching results
    And the counts should update when other filters are applied
    And zero results should be clearly indicated

  Scenario: Search with special characters
    Given I am on the transactions page
    When I enter special characters in the search box
    Then the search should handle the special characters properly
    And the results should update accordingly
    And no errors should occur
```
