# SQL Implementation Journal for 01 - user_registration

## Implementation Summary

This journal documents the implementation of the SQL tier for the user registration feature. The implementation follows the plan outlined in `01-user_registration.sql.plan.md` and adheres to the project's architecture and coding standards.

## Key Decisions

1. **SQL Commands Structure**:
   - Used the existing `user.sql.json` file which already contained the necessary SQL commands
   - Verified that the table structure matches the requirements with fields for user authentication and profile information
   - Confirmed that the seed data includes test users for demonstration purposes

2. **Domain Entity Types**:
   - Used the existing `user.type.ts` file which already contained the User interface, NULL_USER constant, and validation function
   - Verified that the type definitions match the SQL schema and include all required fields
   - Confirmed that the validation function properly checks all required and optional fields

3. **Table Initialization**:
   - Updated the `initialize.utils.ts` file to include the user table initialization with seeding
   - Added a `seedUsers` function to populate the database with test users
   - Ensured proper order of initialization (users first, followed by other tables)

## Implementation Details

### SQL Commands

The SQL commands for the user table were already implemented in `user.sql.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "TABLE": "users",
  "CREATE_TABLE": "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, password_hash TEXT NOT NULL, first_name TEXT, last_name TEXT, theme_preference TEXT DEFAULT 'system', created_at TEXT NOT NULL, updated_at TEXT NOT NULL)",
  "DROP_TABLE": "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users",
  "INSERT": "INSERT INTO users (id, username, email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, theme_preference, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
  "SELECT_ALL": "SELECT * FROM users",
  "SELECT_BY_ID": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
  "SELECT_BY_USERNAME": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?",
  "SELECT_BY_EMAIL": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?",
  "UPDATE": "UPDATE users SET username = ?, email = ?, password_hash = ?, first_name = ?, last_name = ?, theme_preference = ?, updated_at = ? WHERE id = ?",
  "DELETE": "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?",
  "SEED": [...]
}
```

### Domain Entity Types

The domain entity types for the user were already implemented in `user.type.ts` with the following structure:

```typescript
export type ThemePreference = 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';

export interface User extends Entity {
  username: string;
  email: string;
  password_hash: string;
  first_name?: string;
  last_name?: string;
  theme_preference: ThemePreference;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}

export const NULL_USER: User = {
  id: 0,
  username: '',
  email: '',
  password_hash: '',
  theme_preference: 'system',
  created_at: new Date(),
  updated_at: new Date()
};

export function validateUser(user: Raw<User>): boolean {
  // Validation logic
}
```

### Table Initialization

The table initialization for the user table was implemented in `initialize.utils.ts`:

```typescript
const initializeUsersTable = (): void => {
  drop(userSql.TABLE);
  create(userSql.CREATE_TABLE);
  seedUsers();
};

const seedUsers = (): void => {
  for (const user of userSql.SEED) {
    insert<User>(userSql.INSERT, user as Raw<User>);
  }
};
```

## Commit Prompt

```
feat(sql): implement user registration SQL tier

- Verify SQL commands in user.sql.json
- Confirm domain entity types in user.type.ts
- Add user table initialization with seeding
- Ensure proper order of table initialization
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the API tier for user registration
2. Implement the client-side components for user registration
3. Add authentication and authorization logic
4. Implement user profile management
