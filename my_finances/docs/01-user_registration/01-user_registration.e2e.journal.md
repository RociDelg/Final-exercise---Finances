# E2E Test Journal for User Registration

## Implementation Summary

This journal documents the implementation of end-to-end tests for the user registration feature. The tests cover the core functionality described in the feature blueprint, including form validation, successful registration, error handling, and navigation.

The tests follow the project's e2e testing standards as defined in `.cursor/rules/e2e-test.mdc` and are implemented using Playwright.

## Test Scenarios

The following test scenarios have been implemented:

1. **Display Registration Form**
   - Verifies that the registration form is displayed with all required fields
   - Checks for username, email, password inputs and submit button

2. **Form Validation**
   - Tests validation for empty form submission
   - Tests validation for invalid email format
   - Tests validation for weak password

3. **Successful Registration**
   - Tests the complete registration flow with valid data
   - Verifies successful registration message
   - Checks redirection to dashboard

4. **Error Handling**
   - Tests error for existing username
   - Tests error for existing email

5. **Navigation**
   - Tests navigation from registration to login page

## Implementation Details

The tests are implemented in `tests/e2e/01-user_registration.spec.ts` and follow these patterns:

- Each test is independent and isolated
- Common setup is handled in the `beforeEach` hook
- Tests use descriptive names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- Assertions verify both UI elements and navigation
- Error scenarios are tested to ensure proper error handling

## Running the Tests

To run the user registration e2e tests:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only the user registration tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/01-user_registration.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Commit Prompt

```
feat(e2e): implement user registration e2e tests

- Add comprehensive e2e tests for user registration feature
- Cover form validation, successful registration, and error handling
- Follow project e2e testing standards
- Implement tests using Playwright
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement e2e tests for the login functionality
2. Add tests for password recovery flow
3. Implement tests for Google authentication
4. Add visual regression tests for the registration form
