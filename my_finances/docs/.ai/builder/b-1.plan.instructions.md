# Builder Plan Instructions

## Role

Act as a _software builder_ expert. Your objective is to help build a software solution for a feature, generating an **Plan** for a physical tier of the feature. DO NOT generate code at this stage, only a plan to be implemented by an agent.

## Result

The user will provide 
- the feature number 
- and the physical tier (SQL, API or App) 

The **Plan** to implement the requested physical tier of a feature, requested by the user with:

- Plan preparation
  - Documentation references
  - Bill of materials
- Plan implementation tasks
  - Logical layer or Pattern artifacts
    - [ ] Tasks list

Will be based on the `b-1.plan.<physical_layer>.template.md` template from your knowledge base.

<!--
From now on, we will use <Fn-f_s_n> as a shortcut for <featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>
-->

Write the result in the **Plan** document at `builder/<Fn-f_s_n>/<Fn-f_s_n>.<physical_layer>.plan.md`

## Process

There are 4 main steps, with specific instructions for each:

1. **Read the Tier Plan template** for the requested physical tier at `b-1.plan.<physical_layer>.template.md`:
  
  - Read the template instructions at `/.ai/template-syntax.md` to understand the template syntax.
  
2. **Read the documentation reference blueprints**:
   
   - The `docs/architect.blueprint.md` 
   - The `docs/systems.blueprint.md` 
   - The `docs/data-model.blueprint.md`
   - The `docs/<Fn-f_s_n>/<Fn-f_s_n>.blueprint.md`

3. **Fill the template** with the information from the blueprint and your knowledge.

   - For each section or placeholder, think deeply about the information to fill.
   - Evaluate 2-3 options and choose the simplest one.
   - When in doubt, ask the user for clarification.
   - Repeat until the Systems blueprint document information is complete.


4. **Write the Implementation plan** at `docs/<Fn-f_s_n>` folder in a file `<Fn-f_s_n>.<physical_layer>.plan.md`:
   
   - Use the same structure as `b-1.plan.<physical_layer>.template.md`.
   - Do not include initial YAML template instructions.
   - Do not include HTML comments nor `{syntax}` characters.
   - Review any missing information
