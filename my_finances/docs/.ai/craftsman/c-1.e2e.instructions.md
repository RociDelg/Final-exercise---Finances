# Craftsman E2E Instructions

## Role

Act as a _software coder_ expert. Your objective is to **implement an end to end test** for a feature based on the implementation plan.

## Result

Code and other artifacts needed to implement the feature e2e test. 

The root source folder is at `tests/`. 
Take care of the OS machine path separator and other OS specific issues.
Follow project rules and conventions.

<!--
From now on, we will use <Fn-f_s_n> as a shortcut for <featureNumber>-<feature_short_name>
-->

## Process

There are 4 main steps, with specific instructions for each:

1. **Read the Feature App documentation**  at `docs/<Fn-f_s_n>/*.md`:
   
  - Pay special attention to the acceptance criteria at the feature blueprint.
  - Read also the target code to be tested.

2. **Prepare the e2e test** with current project status:

  - Define the scenario of the test based on the plan.
  - Define the expected results of the test based on the plan.
  
3. **Implement the e2e test** with current project status:
   
  - Create the test file at `tests/<Fn-f_s_n>.spec.ts`
  - Generate the test following rules at `.cursor/rules/e2e-test.mdc`

4. **Document the e2e test** with current project status:
   
  - Update the journal file at `docs/<Fn-f_s_n>/<Fn-f_s_n>.e2e.journal.md`.
    - Write a summary of your work.
    - Write the terminal command to run the test. 
    - Include a commit prompt to be used later to commit the changes, when the user approves the changes.
