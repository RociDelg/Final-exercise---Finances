# Feature: **06 - Data Export**

## Description

This feature enables users to export their financial data in CSV or PDF formats for external analysis. Users can apply filters before exporting to ensure they only export relevant data. The export process is straightforward and provides the data in a clean, structured format.

## Involved Data Models

- **Transaction**: The primary data model being exported.
- **User**: Associated with transactions for data ownership and filtering.

## Acceptance Criteria (in Gherkin Syntax)
