  I want to view my financial summary and manage transactions
  So that I can track my financial status and history

  Scenario: View current balance
    Given I am on the financial summary page
    When the page loads
    Then I should see my current balance
    And I should see the balance trend for the current period
    And the balance should reflect only active transactions

  Scenario: View paginated transactions
    Given I have more than 8 transactions
    When I am on the transactions page
    Then I should see 8 transactions per page
    And I should see pagination controls
    And I should be able to navigate between pages
    And each transaction should show its status

  Scenario: Filter transactions
    Given I am on the transactions page
    When I select a date range
    And I select a category

    Then the list should update to show matching transactions
    And the pagination should reset to the first page

  Scenario: Bulk delete transactions
    Given I am on the transactions page
    When I select multiple transactions
    And I click the delete button
