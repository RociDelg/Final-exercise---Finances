# E2E Test Journal for Transaction Recording

## Implementation Summary

This journal documents the implementation of end-to-end tests for the transaction recording feature. The tests cover the core functionality described in the feature blueprint, including adding income and expense transactions, creating custom categories, validating transaction data, and filtering transactions.

The tests follow the project's e2e testing standards as defined in `.cursor/rules/e2e-test.mdc` and are implemented using Playwright.

## Test Scenarios

The following test scenarios have been implemented:

1. **Display Transaction Form**
   - Verifies that the transaction form is displayed with all required fields
   - Checks for transaction type, amount, category, date, description inputs and submit button

2. **Income Transaction**
   - Tests adding a new income transaction with valid data
   - Verifies successful transaction message
   - Checks that the transaction appears in the transaction list

3. **Expense Transaction**
   - Tests adding a new expense transaction with valid data
   - Verifies successful transaction message
   - Checks that the transaction appears in the transaction list

4. **Custom Category Creation**
   - Tests creating a new custom category
   - Verifies the category is available in the dropdown
   - Checks that the category appears in the categories list

5. **Date Validation**
   - Tests validation for future dates
   - Verifies error message is displayed
   - Checks that the form is not submitted

6. **Category Color Display**
   - Tests that category colors are displayed when selected
   - Verifies the color matches the expected color for the category

7. **Form Validation**
   - Tests validation for empty form submission
   - Tests validation for invalid amount
   - Verifies appropriate error messages are displayed

8. **Transaction Filtering**
   - Tests filtering transactions by type (income/expense)
   - Verifies only transactions of the selected type are displayed

## Implementation Details

The tests are implemented in `tests/e2e/02-transaction_recording.spec.ts` and follow these patterns:

- Each test is independent and isolated
- Common setup is handled in the `beforeEach` hook, including login
- Tests use descriptive names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- Assertions verify both UI elements and data persistence
- Error scenarios are tested to ensure proper validation

## Running the Tests

To run the transaction recording e2e tests:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only the transaction recording tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/02-transaction_recording.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Commit Prompt

```
feat(e2e): implement transaction recording e2e tests

- Add comprehensive e2e tests for transaction recording feature
- Cover income/expense transactions, custom categories, and validation
- Follow project e2e testing standards
- Implement tests using Playwright
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement e2e tests for transaction editing and deletion
2. Add tests for transaction search functionality
3. Implement tests for transaction statistics and reports
4. Add visual regression tests for the transaction form and list
