# E2E Test Journal for Financial Summary

## Implementation Summary

This journal documents the implementation of end-to-end tests for the financial summary feature. The tests cover all the core functionality described in the feature blueprint, including displaying current balance and trends, paginated transaction lists, filtering capabilities, bulk actions, and interactive charts.

The tests follow the project's e2e testing standards and are implemented using Playwright.

## Test Scenarios

The following test scenarios have been implemented:

1. **Current Balance Display**
   - Verifies that the current balance is displayed
   - Checks that the balance trend chart is visible
   - Confirms that only active transactions are included in the balance

2. **Paginated Transactions**
   - Verifies that transactions are displayed in a list
   - Checks that exactly 8 transactions are shown per page
   - Tests pagination controls and navigation
   - Verifies page number updates correctly

3. **Transaction Filtering**
   - Tests the filter panel functionality
   - Verifies date range selection
   - Tests category and transaction type filtering
   - Confirms that filters reset pagination to first page

4. **Bulk Delete Transactions**
   - Tests selecting multiple transactions
   - Verifies confirmation dialog appears
   - Confirms successful deletion
   - Checks that selected transactions are removed from the list

5. **Balance Trends**
   - Verifies chart visibility
   - Tests switching between weekly and monthly periods
   - Confirms chart interactivity with tooltips

6. **Transaction Status Display**
   - Verifies that transaction status is visible
   - Checks display of different statuses (Active/Deleted/Modified)

## Implementation Details

The tests are implemented in `tests/e2e/03-financial_summary.spec.ts` and follow these patterns:

- Each test is independent and isolated
- Common setup is handled in the `beforeEach` hook, including login
- Tests use descriptive names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- Assertions verify both UI elements and functionality
- Error scenarios are tested to ensure proper validation

## Running the Tests

To run the financial summary e2e tests:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only the financial summary tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/03-financial_summary.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```
