# E2E Test Journal for Dark Mode

## Implementation Summary

This journal documents the implementation of end-to-end tests for the dark mode feature. The tests cover all the core functionality described in the feature blueprint, including manual theme toggling, automatic theme based on system preferences, theme persistence, component styling, and custom dark mode styling.

The tests follow the project's e2e testing standards and are implemented using Playwright.

## Test Scenarios

The following test scenarios have been implemented:

1. **Manual Theme Toggle**
   - Verifies that the theme can be toggled manually
   - Confirms that all components update their styling
   - Validates that transitions are smooth
   - Tests accent color changes

2. **Automatic Theme Based on System Preferences**
   - Tests theme updates when system preferences change
   - Verifies that the application theme matches system theme
   - Confirms smooth transitions between themes
   - Validates component styling updates

3. **Theme Preference Persistence**
   - Tests that theme preference is saved
   - Verifies that preference is restored after session restart
   - Confirms that the correct theme is applied on reload
   - Validates theme persistence across sessions

4. **Component Theme Application**
   - Tests theme application across different pages
   - Verifies that all components update their styling
   - Confirms that contrast ratios meet accessibility standards
   - Validates consistent theme application

5. **Custom Dark Mode Styling**
   - Tests specific component styling in dark mode
   - Verifies custom styling for charts, tables, and forms
   - Confirms readability in dark mode
   - Validates appropriate accent colors

## Implementation Details

The tests are implemented in `tests/e2e/07-dark_mode.spec.ts` and follow these patterns:

- Each test is independent and isolated
- Common setup is handled in the `beforeEach` hook, including login
- Tests use descriptive names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- Assertions verify both theme classes and specific styling properties
- Error scenarios are tested to ensure proper validation

## Running the Tests

To run the dark mode e2e tests:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only the dark mode tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/07-dark_mode.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Commit Prompt

```
feat(e2e): implement dark mode e2e tests

- Add comprehensive e2e tests for dark mode feature
- Cover theme toggling, persistence, and system preferences
- Implement component styling and accessibility testing
- Follow project e2e testing standards
```

## Next Steps

1. Add tests for theme transition animations
2. Implement tests for theme-specific component behaviors
3. Add tests for theme-specific accessibility features
4. Implement tests for theme-specific performance metrics
