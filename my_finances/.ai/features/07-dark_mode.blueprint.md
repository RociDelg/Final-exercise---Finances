# Feature: **07 - Dark Mode**

## Description

This feature provides users with a dark mode theme option that can be toggled manually or automatically based on system preferences. The theme includes custom styling for all components using the specified Lime and Cyan colors, with appropriate contrast ratios for accessibility. Theme preferences are persisted between sessions, and transitions between themes are smooth and consistent.

## Involved Data Models

- **User**: Stores user's theme preference.

## Acceptance Criteria (in Gherkin Syntax)

```gherkin
Feature: Dark Mode
  As a user
  I want to switch between light and dark themes
  So that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions

  Scenario: Toggle theme manually
    Given I am on any page of the application
    When I click the theme toggle button in the navigation bar
    Then the theme should switch between light and dark mode
    And all components should update their styling
    And the transition should be smooth

  Scenario: Automatic theme based on system preferences
    Given I am on any page of the application
    When my system theme changes
    Then the application theme should update automatically
    And all components should update their styling
    And the transition should be smooth

  Scenario: Persist theme preference
    Given I have selected a theme preference
    When I close and reopen the application
    Then my theme preference should be restored
    And the application should load with the correct theme

  Scenario: Apply theme to all components
    Given I am viewing any component in the application
    When the theme changes
    Then the component should update its styling
    And the styling should be consistent with the theme
    And the contrast ratios should meet accessibility standards

  Scenario: Custom dark mode styling
    Given I am in dark mode
    When I view specific components (charts, tables, forms)
    Then they should have custom dark mode styling
    And the styling should maintain readability
    And the accent colors should be appropriate for dark mode
```
