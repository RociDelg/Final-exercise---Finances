Act as a senior software engineer tasked with analyzing and documenting this @codebase. 
Carefully review the provided code/files and generate a detailed Markdown summary.
Do not add anything else not present in the current codebase.

Create or update a file called `docs/OVERVIEW.md` with the following content and structure:

## 1. Overview

- A 1-2 paragraph high-level description of the project's purpose and main functionality.

- Key technologies/frameworks/languages used.

## 2. Key Components

- Breakdown of major modules/directories with brief descriptions.

- Highlight 3-5 core classes/functions and their responsibilities.

## 3. Data Flow

- Describe how data moves through the system (input → processing → output).

- Note any important APIs, event triggers, or data pipelines.

## 4. How to Run

- Basic setup/installation steps (if applicable).

Format your response using clear Markdown headers. Prioritize concise explanations that would help developers new to the project quickly understand the architecture. Ask clarifying questions if the codebase structure or purpose is unclear.

Add a TOC at the beginning of the file.
Add a link to the project repository at the end of the file.
