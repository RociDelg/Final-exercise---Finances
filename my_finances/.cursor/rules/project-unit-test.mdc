# Unit Testing Rules

Import Jasmine for testing.
Write test in a file with the same name as the file to test, but with a `.test.ts` extension.
Place the test file in the same directory as the file to test.

## Test Structure

- Use the `describe` function to group tests into logical suites
- Use the `it` function to write individual tests
- Use the `expect` function to make assertions
- Use the `beforeEach` function to set up the test environment
- Use the `afterEach` function to clean up the test environment

## Test Organization

- Name input variables with `input` prefix
- Name output variables with `actual` prefix
- Name expected variables with `expected` prefix
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Add comments at the beginning of the test file with the structure of the tests
