# Review

## Code documentation

- Add JSDoc comments to public or exported functions
- Do not add comments to private or inner blocks of code
- Except for really complex code that need a explain for the 'why'
- Use the `@param` tag to describe the parameters of the function

## Project documentation

- Keep an `/docs/OVERVIEW.md` file with the tech stack, folder structure, and high-level architecture diagram
- Keep an `/docs/JOURNAL.md` file with the session chat key actions and decision
- Keep an `/README.md` file with info about the project and the dev test workflow
